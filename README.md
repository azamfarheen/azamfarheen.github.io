28-year old Computer Scientist. I work full time as a software engineer, study part time to be a better software engineer, and clean a lot (because I like things to be clean). I enjoy reading books and manga, watching TV (especially anime and mysteries), and writing silly stories with friends. Hope this class is a fun one!
